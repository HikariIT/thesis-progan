# GAN Neural Networks in Terrain generation

Following code is a part of engineering thesis on using neural networks in procedural terrain generation. There are two provided architectures, located in net/gan and net/vae subfolders. Both of these can be run by running an entry point, `train_gan.py` and `train_vae.py` respectively.
To run tests, run command `make test_py` or to check test coverage, run `make coverage`.
